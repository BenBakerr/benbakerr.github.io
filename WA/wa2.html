        <p>My name is Ben Baker</p> 
        <p>I go by he/him pronouns</p>
        <p>my goals for this course are to gain not only knowledge of tml and coding in general but also an appreciation for programming</p>
        <p>I have never been able to find enjoyment in programming so far at CU and I hope this may change</p>
        <p>I am a senior and am in the process of co-founding a business.</p>
